# FreeRTOS + ESP32: Embedded Systems Programming

This repository contains the source code for an academic extension project on embedded systems using FreeRTOS and ESP32.

The course covers multitasking, real-time scheduling, and inter-task communication. In the final project, you’ll build a dashboard hosted on the ESP32 to control and monitor it in real-time.

Part of [*The Parallel Computing School: Short Courses and Tutorials*](https://github.com/rogerioag/ecp-minicursos).

## Frontend

The dashboard is built with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle and minify the project, making it ideal for resource-limited devices like the ESP32.
