# FreeRTOS + ESP32: Embedded Systems Programming

This repository contains the source code for an academic extension project on embedded systems using FreeRTOS and ESP32.

The course covers multitasking, real-time scheduling, and inter-task communication. In the final project, youâ€™ll build a dashboard hosted on the ESP32 to control and monitor it in real time.
